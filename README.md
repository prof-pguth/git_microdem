This is about 400,000 lines of Delphi code, going back to the first iteration of Turbo Pascal.  This can be compiled with the free community edition of Delphi.

There are directories with compiled executables for Windows 64
--compiled_exe_installation which has versions that were used for publications; the file name includes the date.  Because I do not guarantee that future improvements will be 100% backward compatible, these versions will be mainatined.

If you want to work with the code, I suggest you contact me. The code was not written with the intention of getting to where it is now, and I am working to refactor it to make the variables names more consistent, and to eliminate duplications of code.  Unless I know someone is working on parts of the code, I might make major "improvements" that could make your life difficult.

I am in the process of reorganizing the code, and moving files into small subdirectories.  Old files may still be present; use the Delphi project file to find all the source code files.

The help file is too large to post here.  If you need it, it is online at https://microdem.org  Use its index, table of contents, and full text search.
